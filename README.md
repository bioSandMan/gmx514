# gmx514
This repo contains the files and programs (snippets and full code) for my PhD thesis. 

Clone the github repo somewhere on your local drive you will want to do this on a system with a gui since the jupyter notebook is an html app

`git clone https://github.com/bioSandMan/gmx514.git`

cd to the archived results folder and untar the methane results. 

`cd gmx514/archivedResults`

`tar -xvzf methane.tar.gz`

Go back to the root gmx514 directory and then into the methane_tripep_nbs folder for the notebooks

`cd ../methane_tripep_nbs`

You will need python3 and jupyter installed, there are several ways to do this, just google it

Start the notebook server

`jupyter notebook`

The notebook server is a web server and should  start up a web page with a list of notebooks (ipynb) and python files. click on the notebook link to start the notebook. 

If you get an error, something like "kernel not detected", you should be able to select python3 as your kernel.
