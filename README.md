# gmx514
This repo contains the files and programs (snippets and full code) for my PhD thesis. 

# clone the github repo somewhere on your local drive
# you will want to do this on a system with a gui
# since the jupyter notebook is an html app

`git clone https://github.com/bioSandMan/gmx514.git`

# cd to the archived results folder and untar the
# methane results. 

`cd gmx514/archivedResults`

`tar -xvzf methane.tar.gz`

# go back to the root gmx514 directory and then
# into the methane_tripep_nbs folder for the notebooks

`cd ../methane_tripep_nbs`

# you will need python3 and jupyter installed,
# there are several ways to do this
# just google

# start the notebook server

`jupyter notebook`

# the notebook server is a web server and should 
# start up a web page with a list of notebooks (ipynb)
# and python files. click on the notebook link
# to start the notebook. 

# if you get an error, something like "kernel not detected",
# you should be able to select python3 as your kernel.
